# N.A.N.O: The Last Line

**N.A.N.O: The Last Line** is a single-player 2D platformer set in a post-apocalyptic world.

You play as **N.A.N.O**, a lone infiltration unit deployed after humanity was exiled by a rogue AI that seized control of Earth's nuclear arsenal.

Navigate a decaying missile facility, disable critical systems, and manipulate energy using charged platforms — all in a race to reach the reactor core and shut down the AI.
