N.A.N.O: The Last Line
Embark on a high-stakes mission as N.A.N.O., a lone infiltration unit deployed after humanity was exiled by a rogue AI that seized control of Earth’s nuclear arsenal. 
Navigate a decaying missile facility, disarm critical consoles, and use unique abilities to manipulate energy through charged platforms — all in search of the reactor core, the key to shutting down the sinister AI.
